# Security Policy
Not sure why this project needs one, but whatever.

## Supported Versions

We do not guarantee support. Full stop. You can report vulnerabilities, but we won't guarantee a fix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best way is to fix it yourself - this is a community project, where the community fixes the communty's
mistakes. Just submit a PR. If you don't know how to fix it, you should consider how confidential this is:

- If it puts users at risk of having very private data stolen, including passwords, payment details, addresses of residence etc.,
send me a message via https://keybase.io/ictman . Do NOT make an issue.
- If it puts users at risk of having fairly private data stolen, such as names, ages, dates of birth etc.,
send me a message first via https://keybase.io/ictman - if I do not respond within 14 days, make an issue.
- If it puts users at risk of having trivial data stolen, such as what browser they use, what their timezone is, etc.,
make an issue.

Please use common sense. Thanks :)
